     This SHOULD be used for storage expansion.  If additional
     information needs to be stored within a ZIP file for special
     application or platform needs, it SHOULD be stored here.
     Programs supporting earlier versions of this specification can
     then safely skip the file, and find the next file or header.
     This field will be 0 length in version 1.0.

     Existing extra fields are defined in the section
     Extensible data fields that follows.


    Each header MUST consist of:

       Header ID - 2 bytes
       Data Size - 2 bytes

   Note: all fields stored in Intel low-byte/high-byte order (little endian).

   The Header ID field indicates the type of data that is in
   the following data block.

   Header IDs of 0 thru 31 are reserved for use by PKWARE.
   The remaining IDs can be used by third party vendors for
   proprietary usage.

   4.5.2 The current Header ID mappings defined by PKWARE are:
